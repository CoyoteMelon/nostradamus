# nostradamus
Method to arrange Quatrains to produce coherent paragraphs of text.

Nostradamus’s Les Prophéties (1555–1568) consists of 942 poetic stanzas divided into ten “Centuries” (groups of 100 quatrains), plus two extra centuries (7–12 in some editions) and a sixth century left incomplete.
For centuries, readers have treated each quatrain as independent or loosely grouped by century number.
This document proposes that Nostradamus wrote a continuous linear text and later split it into the century–quatrain grid, using intentionally omitted stanzas as section breaks.
By restoring the original order and reading between these breaks, coherent narrative blocks emerge.


First Paragraph of output text,
The arc of the treasure deceived by Achilles,
the quadrangle known to the procreators.
The invention will be known by the Royal deed;
a corpse seen hanging in the sight of the populace.
Pau, Nay, Loron will be more of fire than blood,
to swim in praise, the great one to flee to the confluence (of rivers).
He will refuse entry to the magpies
Pampon and the Durance will keep them confined.
In the house of the translator of Bourg,
The letters will be found on the table,
One-eyed, red-haired, white, hoary-headed will hold the course,
Which will change for the new Constable.
To the enemy, the enemy faith promised
Will not be kept, the captives retained:
One near death captured, and the remainder in their shirts,
The remainder damned for being supported.
New century, new alliance,
A Marquisate put in the bark,
To him who the stronger of the two will carry it off,
Of a Duke and of a King, falley of Florence,
Port at Marseilles, the Damsel in France,
The chief fort of Catherine will be razed.
